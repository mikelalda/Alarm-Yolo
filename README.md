# YOLO - Jetson Nano

Procedure to make inference in jetson Orin with yolo-v7. [Here](Object_detection_methods.md) you could find more information about object detection

## Set up Jetson Nano

Go to [this](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#intro) step by step tutorial.

## Install dependecies and download packages

Firs of all we will have to install python dependecies. For that open a terminal an execute the followin commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y

pip3 install --upgrade setuptools pip --user
pip3 install --ignore-installed PyYAML
pip3 install Pillow
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install python-telegram-bot

pip3 install nvidia-pyindex
sudo apt-get install nvidia-tensorrt -y
```

For Pytorch installation, first we need to check the Jetpack version:

```bash
sudo apt-cache show nvidia-jetpack
```

After having seen the Jetpack version,, go to this [link](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/). There find the mos apropiate version and copy the link. In our case the following one was selected *https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v461/pytorch/torch-1.11.0a0+17540c5+nv22.01-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl*. So we execute the following command.

```bash
pip3 install --no-cache https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v461/pytorch/torch-1.11.0a0+17540c5+nv22.01-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl
```

After having installed the dependencies there are two options. One is to just use the yolov7.trt file to run the program and the second one is to do all from scratch. Both of them are explained bellow.

## Telegram bot creation

* Search for @botfather in Telegram.

```
```

* Start a conversation with BotFather by clicking on the Start button.

* Type `/newbot`, and follow the prompts to set up a new bot. The BotFather will give you a token that you will use to authenticate bot and grant it access to the Telegram API.

## Run inference

First of all we need to clone the repository and go to the folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikelalda/Alarm-Yolo.git

cd Alarm-Yolo
```

In the file main.py we need to change the line 83 with our token.

Once having done all the steps, run this in the terminal.

```bash
python3 main.py --model_path models/yolov7-tiny-nms.trt
```

## To make a custom YOLOv7 Tensorrt file

After having installed the dependencies and opencv, download the yolov7 implementation and the needed weights. There are more weights into [this](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases) folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7
cd yolov7
ls

wget https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7-tiny.pt
```

Then this model is exported to onnx usin the script provided by the repository owner.

```bash
python export.py --weights ./yolov7-tiny.pt --grid --end2end --simplify --topk-all 100 --iou-thres 0.65 --conf-thres 0.35 --img-size 640 640
ls
```

That onnx model can be checked with [Netron](https://netron.app), an APP for visualising ONNX models.

After that the onnx model is converted to tensorrt (Trt) model with another repository usage.

```bash
cd ../
git clone https://github.com/Linaom1214/tensorrt-python.git
cd tensorrt-python
python export.py -o /content/yolov7/yolov7-tiny.onnx -e ./yolov7-tiny-nms.trt -p fp16
ls
```

Now the model is ready to use with Trt

## To increase the performance, install opencv with gpu

To install opencv with gpu capability. Follow this steps (see the [link](https://qengineering.eu/install-opencv-4.5-on-jetson-nano.html) for more information):

1- Enable the installation

```bash
# a fresh start, so check for updates
sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get upgrade
# install nano
sudo apt-get install nano -y
# install dphys-swapfile
sudo apt-get install dphys-swapfile -y
# enlarge the boundary (4.5.2 and higher) 
sudo nano /sbin/dphys-swapfile
# change the varibale value
# CONF_MAXSWAP=4096
# reboot afterwards

```

2- Install the repo and OpenCV

```bash
git clone Alarm-Yolo
cd Alarm_Yolo
sudo chmod 755 ./OpenCV-4-6-0.sh
./OpenCV-4-6-0.sh
# once the installation is done...
# remove the dphys-swapfile now
sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop
sudo apt-get remove --purge dphys-swapfile
# just a tip to save an additional 275 MB
sudo rm -rf ~/opencv
sudo rm -rf ~/opencv_contrib 
```
